Getting Started
===============

The Getting Started part of the documentation is meant to get you up an running,
:ref:`installation` was already covered in the *Overview* and will be skipped in
this part. Here you can find how you get the SlaxWeb Framework into the web, and
create your first simple application with it.

The application we will build in this guide will be a simple news application, where
we will have 2 pages, one for displaying of said news, and one for creating and
editing, we will also create a third page, which will just be a static page. It
is advised that you go through this guide to get a feeling how applications are
written with the SlaxWeb Framework.
