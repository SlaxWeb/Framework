   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to SlaxWeb Framework's documentation!
=============================================

SlaxWeb Framework is not just another Framework out there that you need to choose
from, when deciding on what tools you are going to use for the project at your hands.
Slaxweb Framework is the first Web PHP Framework built specifically for PHP 7.0 from
the ground up, and at that, is also modular, giving you the most freedom and adaptability
to fit the requirements of your project.

While all this may sound scary, it really is not! The tools that come with the Framework
make it easy to use, and adapt to your needs, so even if you are not exactly tech
savvy, you will not have any issue using SlaxWeb Framework.

If this is your first encounter with SlaxWeb Framework, we strongly suggest you give
our documentation a go, and familiarize with our Framework. Once you are done with
the basic overview of the Framework, feel free to explore the more in-depth documentation
of the class references, and keep in mind, if you ever get stuck, you can always
return to this place, and maybe find a solution for your issue right here!
