Model-View-Controller
=====================

The Model-View-Controller, or MVC for short, pattern has dominated Web Application
Development lately, and we tend to abide it since we strongly agree with that for
what it was intended.  Neatly separate code, so our applications are not just a clutter
of code *smacked* together. However, the SlaxWeb Framework will not try to force
it upon you, you are building your application, not the Framework. But unfortunatelly
all our official components are built with MVC in mind, which might make integration
and usage a bit more difficult.

If you have never heard of MVC_ before, we suggest you read up on it a bit, and
give this page a read as well. The Framework already provides you with a directory
structure that is MVC compliant in the :ref:`app dir`.
