Requirements
============

The modular nature of SlaxWeb Framework allows easy installation and setup with minimal amount of resources required.
It does not even require a database in order to run. The services required are:

* PHP 7.0

Yes, this is it. Since PHP 7.0 provides an internal web server, it is the only requirement to get SlaxWeb up and about.
However, for a full production installation, the following services are recommended:

* Composer
* Web Server, such as Ngix, Apache, etc.

Apart from these we provide Docker_ containers, for easy, simple and fast deployment of a SlaxWeb Framework powered Application.
