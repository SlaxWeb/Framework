Requirements
============

Because of SlaxWeb Frameworks Modular nature, it has very few requirements. It does
not require a lot of services and resources. It does not even require a database
in order to run. Bellow you can find a list of required services:

* PHP 7.0

Yes, this is it. It requires only PHP 7.0. Since PHP provides an internal web server
it is the only true requirement to get SlaxWeb Framework up and about. However, for
a full production installation we do recommend a couple of more services:

* Composer
* Web Server (Nginx, Aapache,...)

Even with out minimal recommended requirements, this is still not a whole lot, and
to the classic Web Application serving methods, we also provide you with Docker_
containers, for simple and fast deployment of a SlaxWeb Framework powered Application.
