First glance at the framework
=============================

Now that you have successfuly installed SlaxWeb Framework, you can finally take
a first glance at the complete framework. We will primarily focus on the directory
structure in this part of the documentation. It is strongly advised that you do
not skip this part of the documentation, as it holds information that will make
developing application with the SlaxWeb Framework a lot easier.

Root directory
--------------

Root directory contains quite a bit of files and directories. Here is the whole
of files and directories that you should see in the directory into which you installed
the SlaxWeb Framework. If you have followed the :ref:`installation` guide on the
previous page, this should be in **/var/www/framework**:

* **app/** - :ref:`app dir`
* **bootstrap/** - :ref:`bootstrap dir`
* **docs/** - :ref:`docs dir`
* **public/** - :ref:`pub dir`
* **CHANGELOG.md** - Changes between version in the framework
* **composer.json** - :ref:`composer.json file`
* **composer.lock** - `Composer Lock File`_
* **docker-compose.yml** - :ref:`docker compose file`
* **LICENSE** - License file
* **README.md** - Short read me file, containing basic information
* **slaxer** - :ref:`slaxer file`

Above is only a simple list of all the directories and files that you will find
in the root directory. Some directories and files do not have links attached, since
they are simple enough to be explained in one sentence. For others, you may continue
