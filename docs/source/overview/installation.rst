Installation
============

SlaxWeb Framework at the time has two very simple installation methods. We provide
ready to use packages, which you just unpack on your local development environment
or on your production server, and we also provide the whole framework in a *composer*
package from which you can simply create your project with composer_.

This installation document will guide you through both ways. If you are not comfortable
with using composer, you may proceed to manual installation using prepared packages,
but we strongly suggest you use *composer*, because the SlaxWeb Framework is built
around it, and its command line tool integrates with it.
