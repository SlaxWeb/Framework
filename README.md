# SlaxWeb/Framework

SlaxWeb/Framework (referred to as Framework from now on) is a modular PHP Framework for
Application development, where you choose which modules to use, if any at all.
The Framework provides the bare minimum that you need for development of an
Application.

It will supply you with all the other modules in the future, but they
will not be hard-wired into the Framework. You will still have an option to
use something else, integrate it into the Framework and thus your
Application with relative ease. Framework will also provide you a convenient
way to install other/third-party modules.

Framework is still in an early development phase. Further updates might result 
in a case where backward compatibility would be broken. Should this happen, 
prior announcement will be made and ways to workaround the issue will be made
available. Nonetheless, it still not encourage to use SlaxWeb in a production
environment.
